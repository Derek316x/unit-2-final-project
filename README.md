# Unit 2 Final Project

## The Journal (or, more generally, logging)

**Project Due:** 10/19  
**Practice Demos:** 10/20  
**Final Demos:** 10/22

## Feature Requirements

* Basic Application
  * A user must be able to log information about a situation. In the context of a traditional journal this would mean using text to feelings/experiences. Or a photo journal, where one would log moments based solely on photos. You get the picture.

* APIs
  * Your application must incorcoporate *n* APIs (n = number of people in your group)
  * You should be thoughtful picking your APIs. Don't select them at random. Instead, find APIs that support the theme of your application and can be used to enhance the experience.
  * 
* Persistence 
  * Your application must incorporate some sort of data persistence. In this unit we've covered three different options: `NSUserDefaults`, `Core Data`, and *remote storage*. There are no requirements as to which option you choose. You should make the best decision based on the nature of your application.
